This Netbeans project using Spring 3.0.2 core libraries as provided by Netbeans 7.0.1. It demonstrates Dependency Injection starting with a sample messaging application that suffers from hard dependencies. From there it gradually transitions to two forms of manual injection, including use of the ServiceLocator design pattern in example 3. From there it transitions to using the Spring Framework and its IoC container for automatic dependency injection in example 4. These samples are part of an e-learning experience host by The ByteShop.Net and its Java E-School. See it at: http://blog.byteshop.net/
