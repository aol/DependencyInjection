# A properties file like this can be used to configure an application
# to use various component impplementations of an Interface. Rather than
# edit source code, just edit this file. The advantage is that your source
# will adapt automatically to the configuration choices you make here. Much
# more flexible. Please note, however, that your IDE will not help you when
# you make typos in this file, so be careful. Also, note that in example 4
# we will use the Spring Framework and XML for configuration ... a much more
# powerful solution.
# 
# key=value pairs define component services
# values that represent classes must use fully qualified names
